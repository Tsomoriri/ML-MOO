# Define tasks
-  select a regression or classification algorithm
-  estimate its hyperparameters using a multi-objective optimiser
-  what are hyperparameters in ml :: weights, number of layers and number of nodes
-  formulate a multi objective optimisation problem
-  use a machine learning method
-  solve it using an appropriate optimiser
