# Define tasks
-  select a regression or classification algorithm
-  estimate its hyperparameters using a multi-objective optimiser
-  what are hyperparameters in ml :: weights, number of layers and number of nodes
-  formulate a multi objective optimisation problem
-  use a machine learning method
-  solve it using an appropriate optimiser

# Define report criteria
- Abstract :: concise , clear ideas
- Introduction :: set expectations
- Background Literature review :: body of literature synthesis,degree contextualisation supports research programme  - no obvious ommssions
- Research Programme :: clear,well-aligned to research questions,sufficient in scale, ambition,plan for assessment of outcomes, degree expected outcomes are reasonable, justified on published research in domain
- Results Presentation :: clear,support topic,support reader alongside  analysis.
- Analysis and contxtualisation of results :: degree analysis results appropraite,data must support,insight into research questiondegree results and analysis are well-contextualised with existing results in literature
- Future research directions :: degree sensible further research directions and questions mapped out. it should be absed on results and analysis provided in report
- Presentation :: degree clear,concise,well-written,well-structured,well-formatted, no grammatical errors

# Steps to REPORT
- A short abstract outlining the document.
- An introduction.
- A review of the literature about the topic, describing the background to the chosen research question and
what work has been done in the existing literature to investigate it.
- A reasoned plan of the empirical work undertaken, including (as suitable), algorithms to compare, test
problems to use, quality measures to employ, experimental protocols, how the results will be evaluated,
etc.
- Your prior expectations of the results, given any insights from the literature and your understanding of
the task and research question. This might take the form of a research hypothesis to be investigated.
- A presentation of the results obtained in an appropriate form (e.g. tables, plots, etc.).
- An analysis of the results.
- A contextualisation of the results, relating them to the existing literature.
- A conclusion which outlines potential future research directions that lead on from your work.
