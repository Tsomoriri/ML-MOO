# Define tasks
-  select a regression or classification algorithm
-  estimate its hyperparameters using a multi-objective optimiser
-  what are hyperparameters in ml :: weights, number of layers and number of nodes
-  formulate a multi objective optimisation problem
-  use a machine learning method
-  solve it using an appropriate optimiser

# Define report criteria
- Abstract :: concise , clear ideas
- Introduction :: set expectations
- Background Literature review :: body of literature synthesis,degree contextualisation supports research programme  - no obvious ommssions
- Research Programme :: clear,well-aligned to research questions,sufficient in scale, ambition,plan for assessment of outcomes, degree expected outcomes are reasonable, justified on published research in domain
- Results Presentation :: clear,support topic,support reader alongside  analysis.
- Analysis and contxtualisation of results :: degree analysis results appropraite,data must support,insight into research questiondegree results and analysis are well-contextualised with existing results in literature
- Future research directions :: degree sensible further research directions and questions mapped out. it should be absed on results and analysis provided in report
- Presentation :: degree clear,concise,well-written,well-structured,well-formatted, no grammatical errors
